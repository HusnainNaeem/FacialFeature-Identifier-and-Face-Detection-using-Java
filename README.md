2. Go to the "File" menu and select "Load File."
3. Choose an image file to load.

### Detecting Faces
1. Load an image using the instructions above.
2. Click the "Detect Faces" button to detect faces in the loaded image.

### Detecting Smiles
1. Load an image using the instructions above.
2. Click the "Detect Smiles" button to detect smiles in the loaded image.

### Detecting Eyes
1. Load an image using the instructions above.
2. Click the "Detect Eyes" button to detect eyes in the loaded image.

### Analyzing the Whole Image
