## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- OpenCV library (ensure it is properly configured and installed)
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

### Installation
1. Clone or download the source code for the Facial Recognition Java Application.
2. Set up your development environment with the required JDK and OpenCV library.
3. Import the project into your IDE.

## Usage
The application provides several features for facial detection and recognition. Below are the usage instructions for each feature.

### Loading an Image

2. Go to the "File" menu and select "Load File."
3. Choose an image file to load.

### Detecting Faces
1. Load an image using the instructions above.
2. Click the "Detect Faces" button to detect faces in the loaded image.

### Detecting Smiles
1. Load an image using the instructions above.
2. Click the "Detect Smiles" button to detect smiles in the loaded image.

### Detecting Eyes
1. Load an image using the instructions above.
2. Click the "Detect Eyes" button to detect eyes in the loaded image.

### Analyzing the Whole Image
1. Load an image using the instructions above.
2. Click the "Analyze Whole Image" button to perform a comprehensive analysis of the loaded image, detecting faces, eyes, and smiles.

### Using the Live Camera
